# Deploying Cleffy — cleffy.io (main) and dev.cleffy.io (dev)

Target end state: `main` builds to **cleffy.io**, `dev` builds to
**dev.cleffy.io**, both served by one Vercel project, with Stripe running in
sandbox (test) mode until the live flip.

Everything in this file that could be automated **has been**. What remains are
the steps that need a human because no API exposes them — each one says why.

## 1. Stripe Customer portal (one click, once)

`stripe-portal` returns 500 for every caller until a **default portal
configuration** exists. There is no API for creating one — the Stripe connector
exposes only `GET /v1/billing_portal/configurations`, and that list is currently
empty.

1. Open the **test-mode** dashboard → Settings → Billing → **Customer portal**.
2. Leave the defaults as they are; press **Save**.

That single save creates the default configuration. Verify with:

```
GET /v1/billing_portal/configurations   # should return exactly one object
```

Until then `stripe-portal` reaches Stripe and Stripe refuses — the function
itself is healthy, which you can confirm with an `OPTIONS` preflight returning
`200 ok`.

## 2. Edge Function secrets

Only three values, and none of them can be committed:

```bash
npx supabase secrets set \
  --project-ref jibgwgosihadbjgxdsfe \
  STRIPE_SECRET_KEY='sk_test_…' \
  STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET='whsec_…' \
  APP_URL='https://cleffy.io'
```

- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` — sandbox account **Cleffy sandbox**, test-mode secret key.
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` — the signing secret of endpoint
  `we_1U8njJ9EqxUjgZtnfBK3y0XH`, shown once when the endpoint is created and
  re-revealable in the dashboard.
- `APP_URL` — where Checkout and the Portal return to. Without it the functions
  fall back to the request `Origin`, which is fine locally and wrong in prod.

To confirm the secrets landed, POST an unsigned body to the webhook:

```bash
curl -i -X POST https://jibgwgosihadbjgxdsfe.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"id":"evt_probe","type":"ping","data":{"object":{}}}'
```

`500 {"error":"Server misconfigured"}` means `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is still
unset — the state as of this writing. Once set, the same call returns
`400 {"error":"Invalid signature","code":"missing_header"}`, which is the
success signal: the function booted, read the secret, and rejected an unsigned
request exactly as it should.

**The seven `STRIPE_PRICE_*` variables are no longer needed.** They are
committed in `supabase/functions/_shared/stripe.ts` as `PUBLISHED_PRICES`,
because a price id is configuration rather than a secret — the same seven values
already ship in `.env.production` and therefore in every browser bundle.
`tests/billing/priceCatalogInSync.test.ts` fails the build if the two copies
ever disagree.

Setting any `STRIPE_PRICE_*` still overrides the catalogue, but
**all-or-nothing**: one override replaces all seven. That is deliberate — a
half-finished live-mode flip would otherwise serve live and sandbox ids from the
same catalogue, which looks fine until a real card meets a test price.

## 3. Vercel project

### 3a. Add a GitHub Login Connection (human only)

Creating a git-linked project fails at the API with:

> Failed to link maxharris1/sheet_music_scribbler. You need to add a Login
> Connection to your GitHub account first.

Fix it once at **vercel.com/account/login-connections** → connect GitHub. This
is an account-level auth setting; no token or API call can substitute for it.

### 3b. Create the project

Team `maxharris1's projects` (`team_Ucc421wJMOxuAagxXETuQp13`), repo
`maxharris1/sheet_music_scribbler`, project name **cleffy**. Vercel
auto-detects Vite; `vercel.json` already supplies the SPA rewrite.

Production branch must be **main**.

### 3c. Domains — the only step left

The project exists: **cleffy** (`prj_aKb8bhLYHDA6P7DFb8F7bENTHUT8`), production
branch `main`, linked to the repo, building on every push. `cleffy.vercel.app`
is live and verified.

`cleffy.io` is already registered to the Vercel account **and already using
Vercel nameservers** (`ns1/ns2.vercel-dns.com`), and `dev.cleffy.io` already
resolves to Vercel's edge. **No registrar or DNS work is required.** What is
missing is only the project assignment — both hostnames currently answer:

```
HTTP 404  The deployment could not be found on Vercel.  DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND
```

and HTTPS fails outright, because Vercel issues a certificate only once a
domain belongs to a project.

In **Project cleffy → Settings → Domains**, add:

| Domain          | Assign to                                                |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cleffy.io`     | production (`main`)                                      |
| `www.cleffy.io` | redirect to `cleffy.io` (Vercel offers this when adding) |
| `dev.cleffy.io` | git branch **`dev`**                                     |

Because the nameservers are already Vercel's, the records are created
automatically and certificates issue within a minute or two.

There is no API for this: the Vercel connector exposes domain _purchase_ tools
only (`buy_domain`, `check_domain_availability_and_price`, `get_domain_order`),
with nothing to attach an existing domain to a project.

## 3e. The `dev` branch — fixed

`dev` could not have served dev.cleffy.io usefully: built the way Vercel builds
it, the bundle contained no Supabase URL (no `.env.production` on that branch),
and with no `vercel.json` every deep link would have 404d, because Vercel's Vite
preset documents the catch-all rewrite as a step you perform rather than
supplying it.

Commit `710bd73` on `dev` adds both, plus the `!.env.production` exception its
`.gitignore` was missing — the blanket `.env.*` rule had been swallowing the
file. Typecheck and all 466 tests pass on that branch.

dev.cleffy.io shares the production Supabase project for now. To point it at a
separate backend later, override `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and
`VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` for the Vercel **Preview** environment rather than
editing the committed file — a real environment variable wins under Vite 8,
which was verified rather than assumed.

## 4. Environment variables on Vercel

**Production needs none.** `.env.production` is committed and client-safe by
design, so the production build is self-configuring.

Preview/dev only needs variables once `dev.cleffy.io` points at a different
Supabase backend (§5). This was verified empirically rather than assumed: a real
environment variable **does** beat `.env.production` under Vite 8, so setting
these for the _Preview_ environment is enough to repoint the dev deploy.

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL       = https://<dev-ref>.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY  = sb_publishable_…
```

## 5. A separate dev Supabase backend — done

`dev.cleffy.io` now runs on its own Supabase project: the persistent branch
**`dev`** (`qdbnlrgylelelvwbkvnm`), a child of `jibgwgosihadbjgxdsfe`. Dev
testing no longer writes production rows.

|                    |                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Branch project ref | `qdbnlrgylelelvwbkvnm`                                  |
| URL                | `https://qdbnlrgylelelvwbkvnm.supabase.co`              |
| Git branch         | `dev`                                                   |
| Persistent         | yes — not auto-paused, not deleted when a PR closes     |
| Data               | none cloned from production; **not seeded** (see below) |
| Cost               | $0.01344/hr while running (~$9.80/mo), $0 while paused  |

Branch compute is **not covered by the Spend Cap**, so a branch left running
bills silently. Pausing is a deliberate act — see the release loop below.

### Configuration lives in `config.toml`

The branch deploy applies `config.toml` to the branch, so the `[remotes.dev]`
block at the bottom of that file is load-bearing: without it the branch would
inherit `auth.site_url = http://localhost:5173` and every auth redirect on
dev.cleffy.io would land on localhost.

Seeding is **off** for the branch. `seed.sql` creates `teacher@cleffy.local`
and `student@cleffy.local` with the password `cleffy-local-test`, which is
written down in `.cursor/README.md` — fine on a local stack, not on an
internet-facing host. Sign up a real account on dev.cleffy.io instead.

Because the branch is unseeded, the `scores` bucket can no longer come from
`seed.sql`; it is declared in `[storage.buckets.scores]` in `config.toml`, which
creates it on any environment built from that config.

### The release-test loop

The branch is tied to git `dev`, so a push to `dev` triggers a branch deploy.
That deploy's health step waits for branch services, so **a push while the
branch is paused will fail** — cosmetic, but expect it. Unpausing does not
retroactively apply migrations that landed while paused; a deploy has to run
after it is up.

```bash
supabase branches unpause dev --project-ref jibgwgosihadbjgxdsfe   # ~1 min
git push origin dev            # or re-run the deploy from the dashboard
# ...test dev.cleffy.io...
supabase branches pause dev --project-ref jibgwgosihadbjgxdsfe
```

### Edge Function secrets do not inherit

`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `APP_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
and the `OMR_SERVICE_*` pair are set on production and are **not** copied to the
branch. Until they are set, billing / AI / OMR paths on dev.cleffy.io fail:

```bash
supabase secrets set --project-ref qdbnlrgylelelvwbkvnm STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=... APP_URL=https://dev.cleffy.io
```

### GitHub integration

Connected to `maxharris1/sheet_music_scribbler`, working directory `.`, with
**automatic branching off** (otherwise every feature branch spawns its own
billed Supabase branch) and **deploy-to-production off** (see the divergence
section — auto-deploying `main` could re-apply work that is already live).

## 6. Smoke test — passed 2026-08-27

Run end to end against the live stack, not simulated:

| Step                                                  | Result                                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sign up via the public auth API                       | user created, session returned                                                     |
| `stripe-checkout` with a bogus price                  | `400 unknown_price` — the allowlist holds                                          |
| `stripe-checkout` with Teacher monthly                | Checkout session created; Stripe customer carries `metadata.user_id`               |
| `stripe-portal`                                       | returns a portal session URL                                                       |
| Subscription created in Stripe                        | webhook wrote `tier=teacher`, `status=trialing`, correct `price_id` and period end |
| Subscription cancelled                                | webhook wrote `tier=free`, `status=canceled`                                       |
| `get_entitlements` over PostgREST with the user's JWT | `tier=free` with the free ceilings                                                 |
| `stripe_events`                                       | both events recorded — idempotency table working                                   |

The tier mapping is the load-bearing result: **no `STRIPE_PRICE_*` Edge secret is
set**, so `teacher` was resolved purely from `PUBLISHED_PRICES` in
`_shared/stripe.ts`. The committed catalogue works in production.

### Cleaning up the smoke-test rows

The Supabase MCP runs SQL read-only, so these were left behind. Harmless — the
subscription is cancelled and free-tier — but to remove them, run in the SQL
editor:

```sql
delete from subscriptions      where user_id in (select id from auth.users where email like 'cleffy-smoke-%');
delete from billing_customers  where user_id in (select id from auth.users where email like 'cleffy-smoke-%');
delete from stripe_events      where type like 'customer.subscription.%';
delete from auth.users         where email like 'cleffy-smoke-%';
```

The sandbox Stripe customer and its cancelled subscription can stay; they are
test-mode records.

### Still worth doing

The portal's **subscription_update is disabled**, which is Stripe's default. So
customers can cancel and update cards there, but cannot switch plans — despite
`stripe-portal`'s own comment saying plan changes happen in the portal. To close
that gap, enable "Switch plans" in the portal settings and add the three
products.

## Migration history — reconciled 2026-08-27

Production and the `dev` branch were both hard-reset and rebuilt from
`supabase/migrations/`. They now carry the **same 22 migrations** — verified by
identical fingerprints (`md5` over the ordered version list):

|                                     | migrations | tables | users | storage objects | fingerprint |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- | ------ | ----- | --------------- | ----------- |
| production `jibgwgosihadbjgxdsfe`   | 22         | 22     | 0     | 0               | `4f0bca6b…` |
| `dev` branch `qdbnlrgylelelvwbkvnm` | 22         | 22     | 0     | 0               | `4f0bca6b…` |

The previous divergence (25 applied in production, 4 at versions in no branch, 8
under different timestamps) is gone. `supabase db push` is safe again, and the
GitHub integration's "deploy to production" can be turned on when wanted.

All prior data was intentionally discarded in the reset: 40 users, 46 documents,
1,063 annotations and 47 uploaded PDFs. The Stripe sandbox subscription that
existed was **not** cancelled — it lives in Stripe, and the database row backing
it is gone, so clean it up in the Stripe dashboard if it still matters.

### Resetting a remote database — two traps

`supabase db reset --linked --project-ref <ref>` is the tool, but as of CLI
2.115.0:

1. **It drops tables but not sequences**, so the re-apply dies on
   `relation "annotations_seq" already exists (SQLSTATE 42P07)` — leaving the
   database empty and half-built. Drop the leftovers first, then re-run:

    ```sql
    do $$ declare r record; begin
      for r in select sequencename from pg_sequences where schemaname='public' loop
        execute format('drop sequence if exists public.%I cascade', r.sequencename);
      end loop;
    end $$;
    ```

2. **`supabase storage rm` silently no-ops** — it returns `{"deleted":[]}` and
   removes nothing, for a bucket path or a single explicit object. Use the
   Storage API instead:

    ```bash
    curl -X DELETE "$URL/storage/v1/object/scores" -H "Authorization: Bearer $SERVICE_KEY" \
         -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"prefixes":["<path>","<path>"]}'
    ```

Note `db reset --linked` **does** clear `auth.users`, but does **not** touch
storage. Pass `--no-seed` against any hosted environment: `seed.sql` creates
accounts whose password is documented in `.cursor/README.md`.

### Why `core_table_grants` exists

On the **local** Docker Postgres image, the default ACL depends on who creates
the object: tables created by `supabase_admin` grant `arwdDxtm` to
anon/authenticated, tables created by `postgres` grant only `Dxtm`. Migrations
run as `postgres`, so every table `schema.sql` created was unreadable and
PostgREST answered `42501 permission denied for table documents` before RLS was
ever consulted.

The hosted images do **not** behave that way — a rebuilt branch shows
`authenticated=arwdDxtm` on every table from the default ACL alone. So
`20260827140000_core_table_grants.sql` is load-bearing locally and a no-op
hosted, which the rebuild confirmed. Keep it: it makes the grant explicit rather
than dependent on which image an environment happens to run, and any new table
should grant explicitly for the same reason.
